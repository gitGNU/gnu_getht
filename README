GetHT - The Free Hinduism Today Digital Edition Fetcher

Summary:
The nice people at Hinduism Today have recently begun freely distributing
their magazine in pdf format, so that anybody may read a copy for free.

However, rather than provide links to the PDF files on their website,
they ask users to download their software which then downloads and opens
the PDFs itself.

This unfortunately means those who are not using a Mac or Windows PC are
unable to download the new issues.

This program is written to change all that.

License:
htde is released under the GPL, see the file COPYING for details.
Basically this means that you are free to study the program, modify it,
and redistribute it however you see fit, provided you extend the same
freedom to others by releasing derivatives with the same license.

Proxy Support:
GetHT supports HTTP, SOCKS4 & SOCKS5 proxys (though they haven't been
thoroughly tested - let me know if there are any problems).
Environmental variables (e.g. http_proxy) are used, but may be overridden
with the following lines in the config.ini file. Any lines which are not
needed (for example the authentication lines) should just be omitted.
The format of the options is:
proxy_type <type_of_proxy> (http, socks4 or socks5)
proxy_address <address>
proxy_port <port>
proxy_auth <proxy_auth_method> (none, basic, digest or ntlm)
proxy_user <proxy_username>
proxy_pass <proxy_password>

Dependancies:
libxml2         To parse the contents and media files; ensure to compile
                with zlib support
libcurl 7.7.2+  To download the necessary issues and periphery
Unless compiled with "make nogui":
fltk    2.0+    To draw and control the windows

Install:
The project is too small to warrent autoconf or anything else complex,
so simply use the makefile provided to compile and install the software
from source.

For more details see the included INSTALL file.
