At the moment this project uses a custom (but very basic) makefile
to make and install. This will soon be changed to autotools, but at
present this way works well enough.

For a default install all that is needed is the following:

1. Decompress/archive the project file:
	tar -xzf getht-<version>.tar.gz
or
	tar -xyf getht-<version>.tar.bz2

2. Change to hdte directory:
	cd getht-<version>

3. Run make to compile the source:
	make

4. Use make again to install it (you'll need to have root privilages):
	make install

For further build options, see the output of "make help"
