== GETHT TODO ==

-------------

-core-

use asciidoc for man / info pages
improve the location of pdf downloads - no need to be compatible, & designed for human-filesystem use
return error if issue / section number doesn't exist

-------------

-cli-

allow multiple -d or -s at a time to download multiple sections. could use an array pointer to do it

-------------

-gui-

remember: most important thing is to have functional code first - can work on user-friendliness later

make a git branch for it
adapt loosely from gui branch (still local at present)
have optional save to dir dialog
don't have download status pop-up have a status/progress bar with each list item

-------------

-meta-

packaging:

submit gentoo ebuild to bug tracker & link to it from getht's page
create a debian/ubuntu deb - see https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/basic-debhelper.htm & https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/basic-cdbs.html

savannah:

perhaps just use webspace rather than recipe tracker
simplify install recipe
add a recipe for uninstalling (i.e. if dir no longer exists, download SAME VERSION and follow 'til make install, where make uninstall is done instead, then delete dir)
add a recipe for running from cron to automatically get new issues

spreading the word:

submit to the gnu directory
submit to apps using curl?
